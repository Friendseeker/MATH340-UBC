### Note on Algebra-Heavy Problems

For problems that involve pages of algebra, the solution
will either:

- omit the algebra
- provide a handwritten version of algebra

As it is rather difficult to typeset long lines of equations. Still, [Vanderbei's online pivoting tool](https://vanderbei.princeton.edu/JAVA/pivot/simple.html)
may be used to check the algebra work.
