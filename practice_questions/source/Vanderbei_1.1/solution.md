### Answer:

- Band: 6000 tons
- Coil: 1400 tons

### Explanation:

We can compute the hourly profit for band and coil production.

- Band: $25/ton x 200 tons/h = $5000/h
- Coil: $30/ton x 140 tons/h = $4200/h

Clearly, we should prioritize the production of bands. Hence, we use all 6000
ton quota for bands (30 hours), and spend the remaining 10 hours to produce
coils. (which is 1400 ton coils)
