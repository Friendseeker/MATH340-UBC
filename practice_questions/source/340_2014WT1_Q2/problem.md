Consider the problem: maximize $x_{1} + 2x_{2}$ subject to
$x_{1} - 2x_{2} \geq 4, x_{1} - 2x_{2} \geq 7, x_{1} + x_{2} \leq 1$, and
$x_{1}, x_{2} \geq 0$. Write this as a linear program in standard form. Use the
two-phase method, adding an auxillary variable $x_{0}$ to EVERY slack variable
equation in the dictionary, to solve the LP. Use the smallest subscript rule to
break any ties for entering or leaving variables. [Hint: This should not take
more than two or three pivots].
