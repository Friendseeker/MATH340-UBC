A steel company must decide how to allocate next week’s time on a rolling mill, which is a machine that takes unfinished slabs of steel as input and can produce either of two semi-finished products: bands and coils. The mill’s two products come off the rolling line at different rates:

- Bands 200 tons/h 
- Coils 140 tons/h.

They also produce different profits:
- Bands $25/ton 
- Coils $30/ton.

Based on currently booked orders, the following upper bounds are placed on the amount of each product to produce:
- Bands 6,000 tons 
- Coils 4,000 tons.

Given that there are 40 h of production time available this week, the problem is to decide how many tons of bands and how many tons of coils should be produced to yield the greatest profit. Formulate this problem as a linear programming problem. Can you solve this problem by inspection?
