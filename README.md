# UBC Math 340 Materials

This repository aims to be the one repository for which you can find everything you about
Math 340.

## Lecture Notes

Lecture Notes are contained in notes.md. To view it, Visual Studio Code or alternative
markdown editors that **support math equation** can be used.

It is currently incomplete and PR is welcomed to add details to the lecture note.

## Practice Materials

This repository aims to contain practice questions & solutions by course topic. Each different
topic would have its own folder, and each question itself would be a folder that contains two 
files(question & solution).

The aim is to have 5+ practice questions for each topic. The main source of the questions would
be a mixture of textbook, past exams and online worksheets

## Past Exams

Other than questions by catagory, we also aim to contain as much past exams as we can find in
the repository under the folder past_exams.
