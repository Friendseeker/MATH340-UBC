# UBC Math 340 Materials

This repository aims to be the one repository for which you can find everything
you about Math 340.

## Lecture Notes

Lecture Notes are contained in notes.md. To view it, **Visual Studio Code** or
alternative markdown editors that **support math equation** can be used.

It is currently incomplete and PR is welcomed to add details to the lecture
note.

## Practice Questions

This repository aims to contain practice questions & solutions by course topic.
Each different topic would have its own folder, and each question itself would
be a folder that contains two files(question & solution).

The aim is to have 5+ practice questions for each topic. The main source of the
questions would be a mixture of textbook, past exams and online worksheets.

The questions by topic can be found under practice_questions folder.

It is recommended that you download the entire practice_questions folder and
browse the contents via **Visual Studio Code**, as Github does not support
proper rendering of Math Equation

## Past Exams

Other than questions by topics, we also aim to contain as much past exams as
we can find in the repository under the folder past_exams. Since UBC Math
Department doesn't provide solution manual to the past exams, we also wish to
compile our own sample solutions such that you can check your answer very
easily.
