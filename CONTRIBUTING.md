# MATH340-UBC Contribution Guideline

## Practice Questions

Each Practice has 3 parts:

- problem.md (or problem.pdf)
- solution.md (or solution.pdf)
- topics.txt
    - contains a list of topics that the question fall under

To create a problem, one needs to create a folder under /source, add the 3 parts, then
execute sync.py to sync the change to topic-specific directories.

### Folder naming scheme

For Vanderbei textbook questions, name the question folder as:

Vanderbei_(Question #)

For UBC past exam questions, reuse the UBC math department naming scheme for exam name, 
then append \_Q(Question Number).

For questions from other sources, it is currently not decided yet. You are free to devise
your own rules.

## Exams

For exam itself, please place it into past_exams/exams folder. For exam solutions, please
place it into past/exams/solutions folder
